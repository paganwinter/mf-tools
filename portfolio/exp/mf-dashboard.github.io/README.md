## 🧮 Calculations & Methodology

### XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)

**Algorithm**: Newton-Raphson method with bisection fallback

**Process**:

1. Collect all cash flows (purchases as negative, redemptions as positive)
2. Add current value as final positive cash flow
3. Use iterative calculation to find IRR
4. Handles edge cases and convergence issues

**Calculated for**:

- Overall portfolio (all-time)
- Active holdings only
- Individual funds

### Capital Gains (FIFO Method)

**Equity Funds**:

- Short Term: < 1 year (20% tax)
- Long Term: ≥ 1 year (12.5% tax on gains > ₹1.25L)

**Debt Funds**:

- Short Term: < 2 years (As per slab)
- Long Term: ≥ 2 years (As per slab)

**Hybrid Funds**:

- Treated as debt for holding period calculation
- Short Term: < 2 years
- Long Term: ≥ 2 years

**Process**:

1. Maintain unit queue for each fund
2. On redemption, match against oldest units first (FIFO)
3. Calculate holding period for each batch
4. Categorize as STCG or LTCG
5. Track realized gains by financial year

### Portfolio Analytics

**Asset Allocation**:

- Uses fund-level asset allocation from extended data
- Weighted by current value
- Falls back to category-based classification

**Market Cap Split**:

- Based on fund portfolio statistics
- Weighted allocation across large/mid/small cap
- Normalized to 100%

**Sector Distribution**:

- Aggregates equity sector exposure
- Top 10 sectors shown individually
- Others grouped together

**Holdings Analysis**:

- Aggregates individual stock holdings across funds
- Filters holdings < 0.01% into "Others"
- Shows nature, sector, instrument details

### Weighted Returns

Formula: `Σ(Return × Weight)` where weight = fund value / total portfolio value

Calculated for:

- 1 Year Returns
- 3 Year Returns
- 5 Year Returns
